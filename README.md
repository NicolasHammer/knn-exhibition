# KNN Exhibition
An exhibition of a KNN classifier built from scratch and compared against its respective scikit-learn counterpart, sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.  These algorithms are compared using blobs of data generated with sklearn.datasets.make_blobs as well as the [IRIS dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris).

The KNN classifier is also shown as a collaborative filter for movie data.
